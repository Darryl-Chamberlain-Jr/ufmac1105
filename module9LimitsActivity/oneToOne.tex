\underline{\href{https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/38913b95b7e94a1bafa4da5313d1c4cf1d}{this video}} to learn what it means for a function to be 1-1 and how we can determine if a function is 1-1.
% OBJECTIVE of video.
Feel free to pause the video and fill out the notes as you go.
 
% Two types: Graphically and Algebraically
 
% Q1 - Determine whether the graph is 1-1 (linear)
\begin{question}
Is the following graph 1-1?
 
\[
\graph[rectangular]{f(x) = 3x+4}
\]
 
$\answer[format=string]{Yes}$

If you are having trouble seeing the Desmos graph, use the ``zoom out" button. You can also interact with the graph! Click and move to look around.
\end{feedback}
 
\begin{hint}

% Summary
\begin{question}
When you started this Objective, you were likely put off by the number of questions. This was done purposefully! Before moving on with the summary, \textbf{have you finished all of the previous questions?}
 
$\answer[format=string]{Yes}$
 
\begin{feedback}[correct]
If you look back, the first 6 questions are exactly the same as questions 7 through 12! This was done to illustrate that \textbf{knowing the general shapes of functions can give you useful information!} In fact, this section can be done very quickly when using the Vertical Line Test. As you learn about new functions and new Coodinate Systems, the Vertical Line Test will stop telling you whether a function is 1-1. But we don't have to worry about that now.
