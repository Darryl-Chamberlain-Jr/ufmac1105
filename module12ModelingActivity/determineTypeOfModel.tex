We summarize the types of models we've looked at below. 

\textbf{Linear Model:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used when we have a \textit{constant} variation between two quantities. 
    \item $y = mx + b$. Can be multiple lines added together. 
    \item Phrases to look for: consant, steadily increasing/decreasing, adding/subtracting [/, /,] every [/, /,].
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Direct Variation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used when we have a \textit{direct} variation between two quantities (as one quantity increases, the other increases).
    \item $y = kx^n$. Joint variation may have more than one variable (like $y = kx^n z^m$)
    \item Phrases to look for: vary directly, directly proportional, ``as one increases, so does the other".
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Inverse Variation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used when we have an \textit{indirect} variation between two quantities (as one quantity increases, the other decreases). 
    \item $y = \frac{k}{x^n}$. Combined with joint variation, there may be more than one variable (like $PV=nRT$). 
    \item Phrases to look for: vary indirectly, directly proportional, ``as one increases, the other decreases". 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Logarithmic Model:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used when we have a \textbf{rapid} early growth, then slower growth later. 
    \item $y = \log(kx)$. Remember that $\ln(x) = \log_e(x)$. 
    \item Phrases to look for: rapid early growth/decay, no bound on growth/decay.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exponential Model:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used when we have a slow initial growth, then \textit{rapid} growth later.
    \item $y = a^{kx}$. Common bases are 2, 3, and $e$.
    \item Phrases to look for: rapid late growth/decay, bounds on growth/decay.
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{General Function Model:}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Used when the problem specifies to use a particular function to estimate the data. 
%    \item Use the general form of the function. For example, if using quadratic function to model data, use $y = ax^2+bx+c$. 
%    \item You may need to solve a system of equations to construct the model. A short review of Substitution and Elimination will be included in the next Objective. 
%\end{itemize}

Determine the type of model that would be most appropriate for each situation below. Answers will be either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear 
    \item Direct
    \item Indirect
    \item Logarithmic
    \item Exponential
    \item General (if we are going to use the general form of a particular function)
\end{itemize}

Kappa Delta is hosting an all-you-can-eat pancake fundraiser to support the prevention of child abuse. Adult (18+) tickets are \$10 and teen (10-17) tickets are \$5. Children under 10 are let in without a ticket. The ticket-sellers only keep track of the total number of tickets sold and total revenue, but want to know how many adult and teen tickets were sold.
