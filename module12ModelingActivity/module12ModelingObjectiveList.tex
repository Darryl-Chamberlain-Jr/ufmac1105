% Introduction to the section. 
We've now looked at how to construct models using linear functions, direct/indirect variations, and logarithmic/exponential functions. This module will focus on putting it all together. As you can expect, there will not be a lot of new material here. If you are struggling with a particular type of model, you will want to refer back to that previous Module. The textbook does not have any sections on solving \textit{any} word-problem using modeling. 

The objectives for this Module are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify which type of model would be appropriate for a real-world situation.
	\item Construct a model equation for the real-world situation. 
	\item Solve the real-world problem. 
\end{enumerate}
