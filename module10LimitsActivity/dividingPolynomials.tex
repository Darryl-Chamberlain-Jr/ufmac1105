First, watch
\underline{\href{https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/0397977141d7448e967c5224b069d4731d}{this video}} to learn how to divide polynomials using synthetic division. This process can be used to divide polynomials by \textit{linear factors}. To divide by non-linear factor \textit{(e.g., $x^2+1$)}, you would need to perform long division. However, this is rarely necessary to solve an equation or graph a function.
 
\begin{question}
First, we start with some questions to learn the terminology for this section.
 
If we were to divide $\frac{9}{2}$ using long division, we would get $4$ with a remainder of $1$. Write what this looks like as an equation, then practice the terminology for each part of the equation.
 
$$\frac{9}{2} = \answer{4} + \frac{\answer{1}}{2}$$
 
$$\frac{\answer[format=string]{dividend}}{\answer[format=string]{divisor}} = \answer[format=string]{quotient} + \frac{\answer[format=string]{remainder}}{\answer[format=string]{divisor}} $$
 
\begin{feedback}
Terminology: ``quotient", ``divisor", ``dividend", ``remainder" \\ \\
Some terms will be used more than once.
\end{feedback}
 
\begin{hint}
You likely know some of these words (remainder, quotient) but not others. You also know ``divisor" though! Try to think of questions that normally ask for ``divisors", like ``What is the GCD \textit{(greatest common divisor)} of 12 and 9?" In this question, is it asking for something that is being divided or something that is dividing other numbers?
\end{hint}

% Question 2 - Synthetic division with integer
Let's see how we can apply this same idea to polynomials.
 
\begin{question}
Complete the division below. Then, rewrite the equation to remove the fractions.
 
$$ \frac{ \sage{dividend2} }{ \sage{divisor2} } = \answer{\sage{quotient2}} + \frac{ \answer{\sage{remainder2}} }{ \sage{divisor2} } $$
 
 
$$ \sage{dividend2} = \answer{\sage{quotient2}} (\sage{divisor2}) + \answer{\sage{remainder2}} $$
 
\begin{feedback}[correct]
Great! Based on the second equation, you can see why we care about Synthetic Division: it gives us a new way to factor polynomials! If only there were no remainder...
\end{feedback}
 
\end{question}
 
Now watch \href{https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/a0b86c86cdcb483ebb38b63684ca5c9e1d}{this video} to see how to deal with linear terms that are not in the form $x-a$. The process is \textit{nearly} the same, except we need to divide our quotient by the $a$ in the factor $ax-b$.
 
% Question 3 - Synthetic division with rational
\begin{question}
Complete the division below. Then, rewrite the equation to remove the fractions. \textit{This time after completing the synthetic division, you will need to factor our the $a$ term. }
 
$$ \frac{ \sage{dividend3} }{ \sage{divisor3} } = \answer{\sage{quotient3}} + \frac{ \answer{\sage{remainder3}} }{ \sage{divisor3} } $$
 
 
$$ \sage{dividend3} = \answer{\sage{quotient3}} (\sage{divisor3}) + \answer{\sage{remainder3}} $$
 
\begin{hint}
You likely got the remainder correct but not the quotient. To see why, let's focus on $\frac{\sage{truncatedDividend3}}{\sage{truncatedDivisor3}}$. This should be the first term of your quotient. Is there a relationship  between what the first term should be and what your quotient is? Maybe check the instructions/video just before this question...
\end{hint}
 
\begin{feedback}[correct]
Right again! Synthetic division can be used for linear terms of the form $ax + b$. To do so, we solve the factor equal to zero and synthetically divide by this zero. Then we divide the quotient by $a$ since synthetic division only focuses on the zero and not the coefficients of the divisor.
\end{feedback}
 
\end{question}
 
% Question 4 - Synthetic division with integer
\begin{question}
Complete the division below. Then, rewrite the equation to remove the fractions.
 
$$ \frac{ \sage{dividend4} }{ \sage{divisor4} } = \answer{\sage{quotient4}} + \frac{ \answer{\sage{remainder4}} }{ \sage{divisor4} } $$
 
 
$$ \sage{dividend4} = \answer{\sage{quotient4}} (\sage{divisor4}) + \answer{\sage{remainder4}} $$
 
\begin{feedback}
We need to make sure there is a coefficient for each term in the divisor. Did you put a 0 if we were missing a term?
\end{feedback}
 
\begin{feedback}[correct]
Great! Synthetic division relies on positions to remove terms and strip down the division to numbers. Not including a 0 for a missing term would be the same as thinking 111 is 1101.
\end{feedback}
 
\end{question}
 
% Question 5 - Synthetic division with rational
\begin{question}
Complete the division below. Then, rewrite the equation to remove the fractions.
 
$$ \frac{ \sage{dividend5} }{ \sage{divisor5} } = \answer{\sage{quotient5}} + \frac{ \answer{\sage{remainder5}} }{ \sage{divisor5} } $$
 
 
$$ \sage{dividend5} = \answer{\sage{quotient5}} (\sage{divisor5}) + \answer{\sage{remainder5}} $$
 
\begin{hint}
	You likely got the remainder correct but not the quotient. To see why, let's focus on $\frac{\sage{truncatedDividend5}}{\sage{truncatedDivisor5}}$. This should be the first term of your quotient. Is there a relationship  between what the first term should be and what your quotient is? Maybe check the instructions/video just before question three...
\end{hint}
 
\begin{feedback}[correct]
Perfect! You seem to understand how to synthetically divide under any conditions. We'll use a lot of synthetic division in the next two objectives.
\end{feedback}
