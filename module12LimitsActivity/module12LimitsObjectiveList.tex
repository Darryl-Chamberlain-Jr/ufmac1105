List of objectives for Module 12L - Graphing Rational Functions.

\maketitle

% Introduction to the section. 
In this last Module, we go back to rational functions. Previously, we only graphed ``basic" rational functions that were in the form

$$ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k $$

Now that we have covered how to divide two polynomials (Synthetic Division) and explored the limit of a function as it approaches a value, we can graph ``general" rational functions of the form 

$$ f(x) = \frac{a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0}{b_n x^n + b_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0}$$

% How does it relate to previous section?

% How will it be useful for the future?


The objectives for this homework are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:KNTP2r7D@14/Rational-Functions}{Use limits to determine the holes of a rational function.}

\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:KNTP2r7D@14/Rational-Functions}{Use limits to determine the vertical asymptotes of a rational function.}

\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:KNTP2r7D@14/Rational-Functions}{Use limits to determine the horizontal asymptotes of a rational function.}

\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:KNTP2r7D@14/Rational-Functions}{Use limits to determine the oblique asymptotes of a rational function.}
\end{enumerate}
