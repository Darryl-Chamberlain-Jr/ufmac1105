\maketitle

In this homework, we will review properties of inequalities and how these properties affect solving inequalities. Since the exams will rely heavily on your understanding of reading an inequality in set notation, it is especially important to work through the first Objective in this Module. 

By the end of this Module, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand what $x \in (a, b)$ means;
	\item Transition from set notation to interval notation;
	\item Understand how to solve linear inequalities; and
	\item Transition from an inequality to interval notation.
\end{itemize}
