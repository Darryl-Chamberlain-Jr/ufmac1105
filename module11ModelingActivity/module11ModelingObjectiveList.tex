List of objectives for Module 11M - Modeling with Logarithmic and Exponential Functions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Introduction to the section. 
So far, we have looked at linear models (with a constant rate of change) and power function models (with a rate of change as $y = k x^n$). These functions cannot model when quantities change rapidly in a short time - we will need logarithmic and exponential functions for this. 

The objectives for this Module are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:_tqWoaDz@17/Exponential-and-Logarithmic-Models}{Identify when a real-world situation would require a logarithmic model.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:_tqWoaDz@17/Exponential-and-Logarithmic-Models}{Identify when a real-world situation would require an exponential model.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.21:_tqWoaDz@17/Exponential-and-Logarithmic-Models}{Construct a model equation for the real-life situation.} 
\end{enumerate}
