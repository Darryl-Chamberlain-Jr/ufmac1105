\maketitle

In this homework, we will review the main characteristics of quadratic functions and learn how to solve them. By the end of this Module, you should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the greatest common factor between terms;
	\item Factor a trinomial with leading coefficient 1;
	\item Factor a trinomial with leading coefficient greater than 1;
	\item Describe the necessary information needed to graph a quadratic function;
	\item Convert between a quadratic function and its graph; and
	\item Solve a quadratic equation with factoring or the Quadratic Formula.
\end{itemize}
