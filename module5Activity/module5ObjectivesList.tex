\maketitle

In this homework, we will explore radical functions, both what they look like and how to solve them.  
The objectives for this homework are: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify the domain on which a radical function is not defined.
    \item Identify the graph of a radical function.
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:uI1As6DV@15/Other-Types-of-Equations}{Solve radical equations that lead to linear equations.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:uI1As6DV@15/Other-Types-of-Equations}{Solve radical equations that lead to quadratic equations.} 
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Note: The textbook does not have a section explicitly describing what radical functions look like. This is why the first two objectives have no links to the textbook.}
