You can print out \href{http://people.clas.ufl.edu/dchamberlain31/files/M5-Objective-2-Graph-Radical-Functions.pdf}{these notes} to follow along with the video below and keep notes to organize your thoughts.

I also suggest visiting \href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sa2j9mats1}{this Desmos page} to see how various numbers affect radical functions. Focus on what changing $h$ and $k$ does to each type of radical function.

% TWO STATIC GRAPHS OF SQUARE ROOTS AND TWO STATIC GRAPHS OF CUBE ROOTS.

% Q1
\begin{question}
Write the equation of the function graphed below. Assume $a = 1$ or $a = -1$.

$f(x) = \answer{-1} \sqrt{\answer{x-1}}$ $+ \answer{3}$ 

\end{question}

% Q6
\begin{question}
Write the equation of the function graphed below. Assume $a = 1$ or $a = -1$. \\

\textit{Hint: Be sure to remove the decimal. For example, if $x$ is shifting by $0.75$ to the right, then standard form would be $4x-3$ rather than $x-0.75$.}

$f(x) = \answer{1}$ $\sqrt{\answer{2x+3}}$ $+ \answer{-3}$

\end{question}

% Q7
\begin{question}
Write the equation of the function graphed below.

$f(x) = \answer{1}$ $\sqrt[3]{\answer{x+5}}$ $+ \answer{-1}$ 

\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write the equation of the function graphed below. \textit{Hint: Be sure to remove the decimal. For example, if $x$ is shifting by $0.75$ to the right, then standard form would be $4x-3$ rather than $x-0.75$.}
