\maketitle

The first type of function we will look at are Linear functions. These are functions with a \textbf{constant} slope. By the end of this Module, you should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe the three types of linear functions;
	\item Describe what is needed to construct a linear function;
	\item Transition between a linear function and the graph of a linear function;
	\item Transition between different forms of a linear functions; and 
	\item Solve linear equations with integer or rational coefficients.
\end{itemize}
