First, watch \underline{\href{https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/be61784320d14422820fb6f774fd7b7b1d}{this video}} to learn how to convert from a graph to its linear function. 


\begin{question}
Write the equation of the line in the graph below in Slope-Intercept form and in Standard form. 

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{question1.png}

Slope-Intercept form: $y = \answer{-2/3}x + \answer{2}$

Standard form: $\answer{2} x + \answer{3} y = \answer{6}$

\begin{hint}
	What do we know about the coefficients in Standard Form? Is there anything special about the coefficient for $x$?
\end{hint}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write the equation of the line in the graph below in Slope-Intercept form and in Standard form. 

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{question2.png}

Slope-Intercept form: $y = \answer{-5/4}x + \answer{-3}$

Standard form: $\answer{5} x + \answer{4} y = \answer{-12}$

\begin{hint}
	What do we know about the coefficients in Standard Form? Is there anything special about the coefficient for $x$?
\end{hint}
