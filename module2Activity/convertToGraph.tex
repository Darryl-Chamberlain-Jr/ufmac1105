\begin{question}
Write the equation of the line in the graph below in Slope-Intercept form and in Standard form. 

\includegraphics{question1.png}

Slope-Intercept form: $y = \answer{-2/3}x + \answer{2}$

Standard form: $\answer{2} x + \answer{3} y = \answer{6}$

\begin{hint}
	What do we know about the coefficients in Standard Form? Is there anything special about the coefficient for $x$?
\end{hint}
