Introduction to Module 1 - Real and Complex Numbers.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Throughout K-12, you've used properties of Complex numbers to solve equations. This Module will review the most pertinent properties as well as review the different subgroups of the Complex numbers. 

We can think of this Module as setting the language and basic skills we will use as we learn/review different classes of functions. Words like \textit{Rational}, \textit{Integer}, and \textit{Complex} will continually appear as we move on in the course. 

This homework does not include a review of adding/subtracting fractions. If you have trouble with this, you should find review material as this will be something you need going forward.
