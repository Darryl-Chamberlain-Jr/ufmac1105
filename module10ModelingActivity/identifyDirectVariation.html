other.</a>
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="noindent">In the last Module, we looked at when two quantities changed at a constant
rate: <script type="math/tex">y=kx</script>. This is a <em>direct variation</em> - one quantity is a constant multiplied by
another quantity. This is still direct variation if we describe one quantity <script type="math/tex">(y)</script> as
a constant multiplied by the power of another quantity, as this is still a
quantity!
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="noindent"><strong>Direct Variation:</strong> <script type="math/tex">y = k x^n</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is a positive Real number.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="noindent"><strong>Identifying a Direct Variation of Quantities</strong>
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">In word problems, we will be looking for the phrases “vary directly” or “directly
proportional”. Outside of these phrases, the easiest way to determine whether two
quantities are varying directly with each other is to graph some values. If the
graph looks like a polynomial or radical function, then the quantities may be
varying directly! <strong><em>Warning: It is difficult to tell the difference between <script type="math/tex">\log {(x)}</script>
and <script type="math/tex">\sqrt {x}</script> from just a few points. If we were given a few points and
not told the relationship between the values, then we would need
statistical methods to determine which function is more appropriate
for the model. For our class, you will be told how to model the
situation.</em></strong>

organize your thoughts.

<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem1"><a id="x1-8r1"></a> [Astronomy] Kepler’s Third Law: The square of the time, <script type="math/tex">T</script>, required for a planet to
orbit the Sun is directly proportional to the cube of the mean distance, <script type="math/tex">a</script>, that the
planet is from the Sun. Should we model the relationship between time and distance
with a direct variation?

<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback2">If we write out the formula described, we would have <script type="math/tex">T^2 = k a^3</script>. We have a quantity, <script type="math/tex">T^2</script>, equal to
a constant times another quantity, <script type="math/tex">a^3</script>. This describes a direct variation! If we wanted it
in our form <script type="math/tex">y = k x^n</script>, we could square root both sides and have <script type="math/tex">T = c a^{3/2}</script>, where this is a different
constant than before. </div>

<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem3"><a id="x1-9r2"></a> [Physics] The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension, <script type="math/tex">r</script>, varies inversely
with the length of the string, <script type="math/tex">l</script>. Should we model the relationship between rate of
vibration and length of string with a direct variation?

<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback4">An inverse variation is described by <script type="math/tex">y = \frac {k}{x^n}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is a positive Real number. The next

<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback6">Our two quantities are population <script type="math/tex">P</script> and time <script type="math/tex">t</script> (in hours). If we want it to double every
hour, we want to multiply by 2 every time <script type="math/tex">t</script> increases - we would write that as <script type="math/tex">2^t</script>. This
isn’t a power function anymore! This would be exponential growth, and something we
will look at in the following Module. </div>

carbon-14, <script type="math/tex">r</script> in the object. Should we model the relationship between <script type="math/tex">t</script> and <script type="math/tex">r</script> with a
