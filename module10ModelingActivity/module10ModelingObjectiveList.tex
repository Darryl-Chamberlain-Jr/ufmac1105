List of objectives for Module 10M - Modeling with Power Functions.

\maketitle

% Introduction to the section. 
In the last Module, we focused on modeling with linear functions. These models had a \textbf{constant} rate of change, which is how we identified the need for a linear model. In this Module, we'll focus on models that have a \textbf{varying} rate of change. We will use polynomials, radical, and rational functions to model these relationships. These are all known as \textit{Power Functions} as they describe a function using powers of $x$. 

\begin{comment}
Linear functions are power functions as well!

The objectives for this Module are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.12:yUH0hROr@12/Modeling-Using-Variation}{Identify when two quantities are varying directly with each other.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.12:yUH0hROr@12/Modeling-Using-Variation}{Identify when two quantities are varying indirectly with each other.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.12:yUH0hROr@12/Modeling-Using-Variation}{Construct a model equation for the real-life situation.} 
\end{enumerate}
