other.</a>
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="noindent">In the last objective, we looked at when two quantities changed directly: <script type="math/tex">y=kx^n</script>. This is a
<em>direct variation</em> - one quantity is a constant multiplied by another quantity. In
other words, as one quantity <script type="math/tex">(x^n)</script> increases, so does the other quantity. We can
also talk about an <em>inverse variation</em> - as one quantity <script type="math/tex">(x^n)</script> increases, the other
decreases.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="noindent"><strong>Inverse Variation:</strong> <script type="math/tex">y = \frac {k}{x^n}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is a positive Real number.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="noindent"><strong>Identifying a Direct Variation of Quantities</strong>
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">In word problems, we will be looking for the phrases “vary indirectly” or “inversely
proportional”. Outside of these phrases, the easiest way to determine whether two
quantities are varying directly with each other is to graph some values. If the graph
looks like a rational function, then the quantities may be varying directly!
<strong><em>Warning: It is difficult to tell the difference between <script type="math/tex">e^x</script> and the positive
side of <script type="math/tex">1/x</script> from just a few points. If we were given a few points and
not told the relationship between the values, then we would need
statistical methods to determine which function is more appropriate
for the model. For our class, you will be told how to model the
situation.</em></strong>

<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem1"><a id="x1-8r1"></a> [Astronomy] The weight of an object above the surface of Earth varies
inversely with the square of the distance from the center of Earth. Should
we model the relationship between weight and distance with an indirect
variation?

<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback2">We see our phrase “varies inversely” between the two quantities we want to model. </div>

<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem3"><a id="x1-9r2"></a> [Chemistry] Ideal Gas Law: The product of pressure, <script type="math/tex">P</script>, and volume, <script type="math/tex">V</script>, of a gas is
directly proportional to the product of the amount of substance, <script type="math/tex">n</script>, and temperature, <script type="math/tex">T</script>.
Should we model the relationship between pressure and volume with an indirect
variation?
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex">\answer [format=string]{Yes}</script>
</p>
<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback4">If we write this as an equation, we see that <script type="math/tex">PV = nRT</script>, where <script type="math/tex">R</script> is a constant. <strong>If</strong> we are
considering the relationship between the quantity <script type="math/tex">PV</script> and quantity <script type="math/tex">nT</script>, we can see it is a
direct variation. Solving for one of the quantities we want to think about, <script type="math/tex">P = \frac {nRT}/{V}</script>. If the
other variables remained constant (say, we had a specific amount of substance and
kept it at a constant temperature), this would give us the inverse variation form <script type="math/tex">P = \frac {k}{V}</script>. </div>

<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem5"><a id="x1-10r3"></a> [Physics] The kinetic energy <script type="math/tex">K</script> of a moving object varies jointly with its mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and the
square of its velocity <script type="math/tex">v</script>. Should we model the relationship between kinetic energy and
mass/velocity with an indirect variation?
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex">\answer [format=string]{No}</script>
</p>
<div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback6">We see the phrase “varies jointly” and are not sure whether this variation is
direct or indirect. It is a common practice to assume direct variation unless
they specify otherwise. In this case, since there is no mention of indirect
variation, we assume the kinetic energy equation is <script type="math/tex">K = c mv</script>, where <script type="math/tex">c</script> is a constant. </div>
